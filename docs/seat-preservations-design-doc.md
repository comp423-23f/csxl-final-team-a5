## Seat Pre-reservation Figma Wireframe

![Presreservation wireframe](/docs/images/reservationwireframe.png "Pre-reservation wireframe")

In the first image of the wireframe the user will be able to see what seats are reservable based on the date they select. Once a date is selected the view is split into two tables with one for the sitting desks with monitors and one for the standing desks with monitors and the times that the CSXL is open. When an individual selects a time that block in the table will turn green. Once they have selected their times they will be able to reserve them with the button at the bottom.

In the second image a user can view their upcoming reservations. With each reservation their will be a cancel button, with which a user can cancel their reservation.
